About this webshop:

S&J Fietsen is the endproject from Sam Wijnsma & Jelle Slofstra for the codegorilla bootcamp and is being worked on.

CodeGorilla provides programming bootcamps in which we have learned to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Laravel.
In this project we combine and practice all of these. This is also the first project on which we're working as a team, using tools
like github, trello, slack and google-meet to coordinate everything.

The assignment was to build a webshop using the languages, packages and tools we've learned about in the 4 months of this programming course.

How to use:

-Clone the repository
-npm install
-composer install
-npm run dev
-php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
-php artisan serve
